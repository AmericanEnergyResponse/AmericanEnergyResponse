# AmericanEnergyResponse
American Energy Response is an initiative of concerned Americans dedicated to combating the energy crisis our nation has been placed in due to the unconscionable actions of our woefully incompetent government.

## Goals
* Identify immediate needs to offset the damage from the Bidet administration
* Identify potential resources to exploit
* Design an affordable off-grid personal powerplant which homeowners can implement to combat rolling blackouts
* Develop alternative fueling solutions to existing vehicles
* Design safe and efficient micro-refineries to allow for production of fossil fuels from natural resources, biomass, coal, and creosote.
* Design affordable power storage systems
* Design inexpensive nuclear batteries and home reactors

## Philosophy
Energy is what provides you with food, shelter, climate control, the water you rely on every day to drink, clean yourself, cook with, all of that requires copious amounts of energy to provide. While those in the country-side will fair better than the cities in the looming energy disaster, we cannot in good conscience abandon the city folk either. It is nothing short of genocide to destroy a nation's ability to produce its' own energy. There are hundreds of millions of people in the United States, many cities boast tens of millions of people, and those people are already at their breaking point from decades of having their country sold out from under them. By crippling our energy infrastructure our government has made it abundantly clear they do not value our lives. For that reason, we have no other option but to organize and distribute the necessary information so that civilians and communities can develop their own infrastructure when the government has finally bled the last drop from the energy sector and abandoned them. To adopt a popular saying, you can't stop the signal.

### Rules & Regulations
We believe that any rule or law which would result in the genocide of any people by any means is unconscionable to its' core. Due to the egregious restrictions on energy in the U.S. endangering over 300 million people, we therefore reject all such laws that could, may, will, or do restrict our ability to generate, provide, procure, create, harness, and otherwise use our own energy sources free from government intervention. This necessarily includes but is not limited to any and all regulations regarding the mining of coal, harvesting of oil and natural gas, distillation of fuels and alcohols, procurement or construction of nuclear powerplants, construction of windmills, dams, solar farms, thermo-electric generators, geothermal energy sources, and and all zoning ordinances, environmental regulations, codes or other statutory rules or laws which have been made to thwart Americans from surviving. We call on all communities to advocate for making their community a sanctuary for energy production. We ask that all law enforcement officers use discretion and leniency if not outright refuse to enforce these burdensome rules and regulations while we are dealing with this unprecedented energy crisis. We ask that district attorneys also treat their constituents with leniency and compassion during this time.

### "Green" vs Fossil Fuels
We do not differentiate, nor do we care. There is not much point in saving a planet if you are dead.

### Climate change
Climate change is a secondary issue to the immediate survival of 300 million + Americans. We believe that energy sources should be engineered to be as clean as possible.

### Electric Cars?
Electric cars are nice, but generally impractical for the average person and place unnecessary strain on the electrical grid. Most used cars in the U.S. run off of gasoline, and these are the cars that most Americans drive, not the $50k Tesla, the throttle-body injected Dodge from the 90's they bought 2 years ago at a junk yard for $800. We believe that producing alternative fuels for these vehicles and techniques to modify engines to run on lower grade fuel (such as retarding the timing to prevent detonation) are much more reasonable and immediate alternatives for the average person.
