# AmericanEnergyResponse
American Energy Response is an initiative of concerned Americans dedicated to combating the energy crisis our nation has been placed in due to the unconscionable actions of our woefully incompetent government.

## Goals
* Identify immediate needs to offset the damage from the Bidet administration
* Identify potential resources to exploit
* Design an affordable off-grid personal powerplant which homeowners can implement to combat rolling blackouts
* Develop alternative fueling solutions to existing vehicles
* Design safe and efficient micro-refineries to allow for production of fossil fuels from natural resources, biomass, coal, and creosote.
* Design affordable power storage systems
* Design inexpensive nuclear batteries and home reactors

## Philosophy
Energy is what provides you with food, shelter, climate control, the water you rely on every day to drink, clean yourself, cook with, all of that requires copious amounts of energy to provide. While those in the country-side will fair better than the cities in the looming energy disaster caused by the wanton disregard for reality by the batshit crazy Democrats and the worthless Republicans doing nothing to stop them, it is still nothing short of genocide to destroy a nation's ability to produce its' own energy. There are hundreds of millions of people in the United States, many cities boast tens of millions of people, and those people are already at their breaking points from decades of having their country sold out from under them by the worthless crooks in our government, not just the politicians, but the unelected beaurocrats and their insane red-tape. 

### Rules & Regulations
We believe that any rule or law which would result in the genocide of any people by any means is unconscionable to its' core and as such we reject all such laws that could, may, will, or do restrict our ability to generate, provide, procure, create, harness, and otherwise use our own energy sources free from government intervention. This necessarily includes any and all regulations regarding the mining of coal, harvesting of oil and natural gas, distillation of fuels and alcohols, procurement or construction of nuclear powerplants, construction of windmills, dams, solar farms, thermo-electric generators, geothermal energy sources, and any and all zoning ordinances, regulations, codes or other statutory rules or laws which have been made to thwart Americans from surviving.

### "Green" vs Fossil Fuels
We do not differentiate, nor do we care. There is not much point in saving a planet if you are dead.

### Climate change
Climate change is a secondary issue to the immediate survival of 300 million + Americans. We believe that energy sources should be engineered to be as clean as possible.

### Electric Cars?
Electric cars are nice, but generally impractical for the average person and place unnecessary strain on the electrical grid. Most used cars in the U.S. run off of gasoline, and these are the cars that most Americans drive, not the $50k Tesla, the throttle-body injected Dodge from the 90's they bought 2 years ago at a junk yard for $800. We believe that producing alternative fuels for these vehicles and techniques to modify engines to run on lower grade fuel (such as retarding the timing to prevent detonation) are much more reasonable and immediate alternatives for the average person.
